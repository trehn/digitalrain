# Digital Rain: Matrix Screensaver for macOS

[![Animated preview](/preview.gif)](https://rezmason.github.io/matrix)

This is a wrapper around the magnificent [Matrix visualization by Rezmason](https://github.com/Rezmason/matrix) so you can enjoy it as a screensaver. All credit for the visuals to them.

Runs a local copy of the visualization (so it will work offline) and provides a UI to configure all settings:

Download from [the Releases page](https://github.com/trehn/digitalrain/releases), double-click to install, then open System Settings > Wallpaper > Screen Saver... > Other > Show all...

> [!WARNING]
> If you cannot open the "Options..." window for a screensaver, restart the System Settings app. This is an unfortunate bug in macOS that I can't do anything about.
